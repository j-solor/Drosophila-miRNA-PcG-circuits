# In-silico analysis of the microRNAs and the Polycomb group of genes regulatory circuit in Drosophila melanogaster.
> Master in Bioinformatica 
All the data and code from my master degree thesis
is aviliable in this repository. It can be further
divided in 3 parts each one containing a html of 
the Jupyter noteboook for fast access
  

### Generation of the High Confidence Integrated microRNA Taget prediction set (HCImiRTps)
> Located at ["HCImiRTPs_generation" directory](https://github.com/JacoboSolorzano/TFM/tree/master/HCImiRTps_generation "Title")

Code and data from the generation of HCImiRTPs through the integration of TargetScanFlyV7 predictions with Wessels et al., 2019 AGO-PARCLIP experimental microRNA target set.
<br/><br/>


### Generation of the High Confidence Polycomb Response Element prediction set (HCPREps)
> Located at ["HCPREps_generation" directory](https://github.com/JacoboSolorzano/TFM/tree/master/HCPREps_generation "Title")

Code and data from the generation of HCPREps  through the intersection of SVM-MOCCA and Khabiri and Freddolino, 2019 Polycomb response element (PRE) predictions.
<br/><br/>


### Analysis of HCImiRTps and HCPREps
> Located at ["Analysis" directory](https://github.com/JacoboSolorzano/TFM/tree/master/Analysis "Title")

Code and data from the analysis of HCImiRTPs and HCPREps. This section includes from the enrichment analysis and distance to the closest PRE calculation to the exploration of cross-talking miRNAs.
